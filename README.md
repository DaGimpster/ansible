DaGimpster's Ansible dumping spot!

This is my personal Ansible playbook repository. I'll add more useful documentation to this later, but the ultimate goal is mass deployment of Hadoop infrastructure. The network config is rather basic at the moment, and I owe a lot to Robert Verspuy (http://exarv.nl) for the idea of deploying by MAC address. 

If you use anything, more power to you. Make sure to remove my .pub key... unless you want me to be able to SSH into your stuff anyway :)
